			<h1>Diodes: The One-Way Streets of Electronics</h1>
			<p class="text">One of the most basic parts in an electronic circuit, the humble diode serves a very important purpose in controlling current flow. Imagine a bustling city with intricate roads, traffic signals, and hidden shortcuts. In the realm of electronics, diodes are our one-way streets, guiding electrons with unwavering authority. At its core, a diode is a semiconductor device with a simple mission: to allow current flow in one direction while blocking it in the other. Picture a gatekeeper at a turnstileâ€”when electrons approach from the anode (positive side), the gate swings open, welcoming them into the circuit. But those coming from the cathode (negative side) are blocked, and the gate remains firmly shut.</p>

			<p class="text">To begin, let's start with the most fundamental element, the atom. For our case, we are interested in how atoms interact with other. At the atomic level, atoms with the same charge will repel each other, while those with opposite charges will attract. In the demo above, the cursor acts as the same charge of the atoms flowing around. Notice how as the cursor gets close to the atoms they move out of the way.</p>
