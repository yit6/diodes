			<h1>Diodes: The One-Way Streets of Electronics</h1>
			<p class="text">One of the most basic parts in an electronic circuit, the humble diode serves a very important purpose in controlling current flow. Imagine a bustling city with intricate roads, traffic signals, and hidden shortcuts. In the realm of electronics, diodes are our one-way streets, guiding electrons with unwavering authority. At its core, a diode is a semiconductor device with a simple mission: to allow current flow in one direction while blocking it in the other. Picture a gatekeeper at a turnstileâ€”when electrons approach from the anode (positive side), the gate swings open, welcoming them into the circuit. But those coming from the cathode (negative side) are blocked, and the gate remains firmly shut.</p>

			<p class="text">To begin, let's start with the most fundamental element, the atom. For our case, we are interested in how atoms interact with other. At the atomic level, atoms with the same charge will repel each other, while those with opposite charges will attract. In the demo above, the cursor acts as the same charge of the atoms flowing around. Notice how as the cursor gets close to the atoms they move out of the way. Now that we have gotten that out of the way, we will look closer at the construction of the diode. A diode is split into two sections, p-type (which is missing electrons) and n-type (which has excess electrons). How these two types are achieved is through a process known as doping; chemical impurities are introducted in a controlled manner into pure sillicon such as to alter the chemical makeup of the silicon crystal. Depending on what element is doped into the silicon, it may result in the silicon having more or less electrons. If you put these p-type and n-type semiconductors together, you get what is called a pn junction. At this junction, a depletion region is formed due to the migration of electrons and holes (electron vacancies). The depletion region establishes an electric field that prevents current flow in the reverse direction</p>
